### Problem this software solve

In today's digital age, it is becoming increasingly important to develop secure and efficient methods of personal identification. Our main aim is to develop a facial recognition system that can accurately and reliably identify individuals by name which can be deployed on the places where the crime rate is high.

### Tech Stack

1. OpenCV â€“ It is an open-source computer vision and machine learning library that provides the tools and algorithms required to detect faces and perform facial recognition. 
2. Machine Learning - The face recognition model is trained using machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines.
3. Back-end - The backend of our software is developed using a programming language such as Python.
4. Front-end - The frontend of the system is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Features

1. Our system can be used to manage student attendance in large schools and colleges.

2. Our system can be deployed in the public places where the crime rate is high.

3. Our system can be used in corporate offices to manage employee attendance, reducing manual workload, etc.

4. Our system can be used in hospitals to track the attendance of medical staff and ensure that there is always enough staff on duty to meet the needs of patients.

5. Our system can be used in government offices to manage the attendance of employees, reducing manual workload and improving efficiency in the management of public services.

### Applications

In ATM'S: Face recognition technology can be used in ATMs to prevent fraud and improve security. User identification: Face recognition technology can be used to identify the user attempting to withdraw money from an ATM. This can help prevent fraud by ensuring that only authorized users have access to the ATM and their accounts.

In College/University: Face recognition technology can be used to grant access to secure areas of the college, such as laboratories, libraries, or administrative offices. This can help prevent unauthorized access and ensure the safety of students, staff, and assets. Particulary for the PIET, Jaipur.The college liabrary has a system which monitors the student entry and exit in the liabrary. It uses the scanner to scan the id of particular student to detect the attendance of the student in the liabrary.

In Government services: The 'SmartFace' can also be used by government agencies to prevent identity fraud and improve security, such as during passport applications or border control or during driving license applications and there are many more. Face recognition technology can be used to identify criminals by matching surveillance footage or other images with criminal databases. This can help prevent crime and improve public safety.

Financial services: It can be used in banks and financial organisations(Online banking). Face recognition technology can be used to verify the identities of their customers during online transactions, such as transferring funds or making payments, customers applying for loans etc.This helps prevent fraudsters from accessing accounts or making unauthorized transactions.

### Conclusion & Vision for this software

Our main aim is to developing a platform where various organization like Educational institutes, Corporate offices, etc. can identify the person.
The unique value proposition of this system is that it offers a fast and reliable way to track attendance, eliminating the need for manual attendance records and reducing the risk of errors.
Out software can be deployed in public places where the crime rate is high.
